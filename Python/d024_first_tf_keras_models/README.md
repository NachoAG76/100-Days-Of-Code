The files in this folder for day 24 of #100DaysOfCode are based mostly on the "Learn and use ML" section at the [tensorflow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). The files are only used to show that I went through the tutorials and had some beginning exposure to Tensorflow and its high-level wrapper, Keras. These files shouldn't be used for learning purposes for yourself, as I don't have any of the explanations like the actual tutorials do. I may add explanations in my own words in the future, but for now, please refer to the tutorial website for detailed and reliable and up-to-date information.
