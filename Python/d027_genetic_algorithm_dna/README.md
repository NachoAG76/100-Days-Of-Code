This DNA file is based off of https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/ by Daniel Shiffman. Go there if you'd like tutorials on Processing and the details of developing genetic algorithms.

The other files will be created in the upcoming days, I was mostly studying how the DNA class works today.
